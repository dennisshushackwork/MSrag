Title: A Phylogeny-Based Global Nomenclature System and Automated Annotation Tool for H1 Hemagglutinin Genes from Swine Influenza A Viruses
Passage: The 1B human seasonal lineage within-and between-clade APDs are presented in Table 3 . For the most part, each clade had an APD of Ͼ7% from other clades and almost all had an APD of Ͻ7% within the clade. The within-clade exceptions were the 1B.1 and 1B.2 clades . The 1B.1 second-order clade had too few representative sequences to calculate genetic distance, and 1B.2 represented multiple monophyletic clades that individually did not meet our criteria for further division. Similarly, the extensive 1B.1.1 clade did not meet criteria for further splitting. The exception to the between-clade threshold was associated with clades
