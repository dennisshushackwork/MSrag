Title: The Role of Type III Interferons in Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Therapy
Passage: Worldwide 92-149 million people, representing approximately 2% of the world's population, are chronically infected with HCV , one of the causative agents of viral hepatitis. HCV is a blood borne virus and transmission occurs parenterally, mainly by reusing injection material, insufficient sterilization of medical tools, or by transfusion of unscreened blood or blood products.
