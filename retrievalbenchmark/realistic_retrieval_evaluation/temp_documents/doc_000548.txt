Title: Viral vector-based influenza vaccines
Passage: being made to AAV to increase immunogenicity. 220 A limited number of studies evaluating AAV as a vector for influenza vaccination has been performed . Initially, an AAV expressing the HA gene or NP gene was shown to be protective in mice. 221, 222 A more recent study tested AAV vaccines expressing the HA, NP or M1 genes of H1N1pdm09 in mice. Whereas AAV-HA afforded full protection from H1N1pdm09 infection, AAV-NP protected mice partially and AAV-M1 did not afford protection. Simultaneous vaccination with all 3 constructs afforded protection from homologous challenge infection. 223 Recently, in an alternative vaccination approach, AAV
