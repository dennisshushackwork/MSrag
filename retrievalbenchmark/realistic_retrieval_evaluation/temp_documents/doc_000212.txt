Title: Group Selection and Contribution of Minority Variants during Virus Adaptation Determines Virus Fitness and Phenotype
Passage: doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004838.g002 tolerated. To confirm these modelled predictions, we generated each mutation on both backgrounds and measured the relative fitness. Indeed, the D138G mutation alone on the WT background conferred nearly a ten-fold drop in fitness and the Q234K mutation conferred up to 100-fold drop in fitness , while the fitness costs of these mutations on the E76G background resulted in neutral fitness relative to WT. The data suggest that epistasis between these mutations and the E76G mutation rescues the fitness of these double variants and permits their positive selection in the viral population. Interestingly, the D138G and Q234K variants seemed
