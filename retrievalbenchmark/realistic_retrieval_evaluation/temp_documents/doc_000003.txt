Title: Performance and workflow assessment of six nucleic acid extraction technologies for use in resource limited settings
Passage: based detection from the NA extracts as compared to reference methods using the MagNaPure or Qiagen kits . While important, analytical performance is not the only metric that should be considered when ranking the technologies. We also applied the ASSUR criteria defined in the Results section in a series of Radar plots to visually compare each technology with each sample type assessed for both target microbes . The normalized parameters in each panel were average by panel and also overall to permit ranking of each technology in comparison to simply performance .
