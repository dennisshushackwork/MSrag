Title: Discovering myeloid cell heterogeneity in the lung by means of next generation sequencing
Passage: In 1977, Sanger and colleagues published a methodological paper on determining the DNA sequence, providing a tool for deciphering complete genes. This sequencing method, also known as Sanger sequencing, is based on specific chain-terminating inhibitors of DNA polymerase and was subsequently the most widely used sequencing method for the next 30 years. Sanger sequencing was able to obtain the sequence of DNA as long as 1000 bp with high accuracy. However, this low-throughput sequencing method was expensive, time consuming and insufficient to achieve the ultimate goal of deciphering the complicated biological genome. These weaknesses drove the development of high-throughput sequencing:
