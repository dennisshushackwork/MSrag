Title: Quantifying the value of surveillance data for improving model predictions of lymphatic filariasis elimination
Passage: be exploited both scientifically and in management . Specifically, we suggest that these surveillance data need to be analysed using models in a manner that allows the extraction of maximal information about the monitored dynamical systems so that this can be used to better guide both the collection of such data as well as the provision of more precise estimates of the system state for use in making state-dependent decisions . Currently, parasite control programmes use infection monitoring data largely from sentinel sites primarily to determine if an often arbitrarily set target is met . Little consideration is given to
