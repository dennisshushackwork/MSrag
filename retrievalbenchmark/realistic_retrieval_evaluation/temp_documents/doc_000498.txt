Title: From Theory to Practice: Translating Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) into the Clinic
Passage: Relative to the time required for culture and downstream analysis of the data, variation in the speed of different sequencing technologies is relatively modest. There is considerable enthusiasm for the Oxford Nanopore Technology which outputs data in real time, although the ONT requires a comparable amount of time to the popular Illumina Miseq sequencer to generate the same volume of sequence data. Sequencing on the MiSeq sequencer takes between 13 to 56 hours, but as run time correlates with sequence output and read length, researchers tend to systematically favour runs of longer duration.
