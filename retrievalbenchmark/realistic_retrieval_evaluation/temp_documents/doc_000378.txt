Title: RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Speed and Fidelity are not the Only Determinants of the Mechanism or Efficiency of Recombination
Passage: double mutants . The differences in outcome could reflect the differences in replication efficiency and/or a direct consequence of the substitutions in 3D-coding sequence on virus assembly or spread caused by changes to 3CD protein or 3D-containing precursor protein . After a productive infection, the exponential phase of genome replication by PV typically occurs between 2 and 6 h post-infection, with virus assembly occurring between 4 and 8 h post-infection. Release of infectious virus by lytic and/or non-lytic mechanisms can occur once virus is assembled and can persist for longer than 24 hours.
