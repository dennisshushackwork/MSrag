Title: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission
Passage: MERS-CoV was found and characterized because of its apparent association with severe, and therefore more obvious, illness in humans; we were the canaries in the coal mine. Sero-assays and prospective cohort studies have yet to determine the extent to which milder or asymptomatic cases contribute to MERS-CoV transmission chains. However, transmission of MERS-CoV is defined as sporadic , intra-familial, often healthcare associated, inefficient and requiring close and prolonged contact In a household study, 14 of 280 contacts of 26 MERS-CoV positive index patients were RNA or antibody positive; the rate of general transmission, even in outbreaks is around 3 %
