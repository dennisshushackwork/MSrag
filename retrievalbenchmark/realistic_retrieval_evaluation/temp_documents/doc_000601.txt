Title: Targeted Versus Continuous Delivery of Volatile Anesthetics During Cholinergic Bronchoconstriction
Passage: robust estimates of lung mechanics could help to resolve these discrepancies. Nevertheless, although we were unable to detect significant bronchodilation during inhaled anesthetic delivery, our targeted delivery system indicates that it is possible to deliver inhaled anesthetics predominately to the anatomic dead space, resulting in reduced systemic dose. Thus it may be possible to achieve direct pharmacologic action on airway smooth muscle, with less potential for systemic absorption.
