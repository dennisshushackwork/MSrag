in some cases , indemnification obligations of the types described above arise under arrangements entered into by predecessor companies for which we become responsible as a result of the acquisition . pursuant to their bylaws , pnc and its subsidiaries provide indemnification to directors , officers and , in some cases , employees and agents against certain liabilities incurred as a result of their service on behalf of or at the request of pnc and its subsidiaries . pnc and its subsidiaries also advance on behalf of covered individuals costs incurred in connection with certain claims or proceedings , subject to written undertakings by each such individual to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that the individual is not entitled to indemnification . we generally are responsible for similar indemnifications and advancement obligations that companies we acquire had to their officers , directors and sometimes employees and agents at the time of acquisition . we advanced such costs on behalf of several such individuals with respect to pending litigation or investigations during 2012 . it is not possible for us to determine the aggregate potential exposure resulting from the obligation to provide this indemnity or to advance such costs . visa indemnification our payment services business issues and acquires credit and debit card transactions through visa u.s.a . inc . card association or its affiliates ( visa ) . in october 2007 , visa completed a restructuring and issued shares of visa inc . common stock to its financial institution members ( visa reorganization ) in contemplation of its initial public offering ( ipo ) . as part of the visa reorganization , we received our proportionate share of a class of visa inc . common stock allocated to the us members . prior to the ipo , the us members , which included pnc , were obligated to indemnify visa for judgments and settlements related to the specified litigation . as a result of the acquisition of national city , we became party to judgment and loss sharing agreements with visa and certain other banks . the judgment and loss sharing agreements were designed to apportion financial responsibilities arising from any potential adverse judgment or negotiated settlements related to the specified litigation . in july 2012 , visa funded $ 150 million into their litigation escrow account and reduced the conversion rate of visa b to a shares . we continue to have an obligation to indemnify visa for judgments and settlements for the remaining specified litigation , therefore we may have additional exposure to the specified visa litigation . recourse and repurchase obligations as discussed in note 3 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities , pnc has sold commercial mortgage , residential mortgage and home equity loans directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement . one form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets . commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations we originate , close and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnma 2019s dus program . we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc . under these programs , we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement . at december 31 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 , the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was $ 12.8 billion and $ 13.0 billion , respectively . the potential maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was $ 3.9 billion at december 31 , 2012 and $ 4.0 billion at december 31 , 2011 . we maintain a reserve for estimated losses based upon our exposure . the reserve for losses under these programs totaled $ 43 million and $ 47 million as of december 31 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 , respectively , and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet . if payment is required under these programs , we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred , although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses . our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment . table 154 : analysis of commercial mortgage recourse obligations .
