Title: A real-time spatio-temporal syndromic surveillance system with application to small companion animals
Passage: End-users of a real-time surveillance system will be responsible for receiving system outputs, interpreting them, and if necessary following up on alarms. Therefore, in addition to flexibility, another important attribute of a surveillance system should be that it reports outcomes in an easily interpretable manner. Our system generates outputs in the form of practice-specific time-series and maps that display the spatio-temporal evolution of GI disease risk over an area of interest in a user-friendly manner; see Fig. 3 . Additionally, we have illustrated the use of a traffic-light device as a visual aid for analysts to quickly identify potential GI
