we anticipate that assumption changes will decrease 2018 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 164 million as compared with approximately $ 199 million in 2017 , excluding amounts related to early retirement programs . the anticipated decrease is primarily due to higher expected return on assets of $ 21 million , coupled with lower amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for prior service cost of $ 12 million and unrecognized actuarial gains/losses of $ 10 million , partially offset by other movements of $ 8 million . weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans . a fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2018 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 38 million , and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2018 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 54 million . similarly , a fifty-basis-point decrease ( increase ) in the expected return on plan assets would increase ( decrease ) our 2018 pension expense by approximately $ 45 million . see item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates. .
