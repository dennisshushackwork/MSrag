Title: Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors â€“ friend or foe?
Passage: was the first to be licensed for use in humans, where the cDNAs encoding the envelope proteins of YFV were replaced with the corresponding genes of an attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus strain, SA14-14-2 . Poxviruses are also studied extensively as candidate vectors for human use, among which attenuated derivatives of vaccinia virus and New York attenuated vaccinia virus NYVAC strains] are the most promising vectors . They are ideal candidate vectors due to their large DNA-packing capacity and their thermal and genetic stability . The NYVAC vector has been shown to induce CD4 + T cell-dominant responses, and MVA induces
