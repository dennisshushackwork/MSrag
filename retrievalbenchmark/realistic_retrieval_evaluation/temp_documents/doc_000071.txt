Title: Tollip or Not Tollip: What Are the Evolving Questions behind It?
Passage: The average length of Tollip was 262 amino acids with a standard deviation of 64 amino acids; and the molecular weight average was 31.33 kDa with a standard deviation of 6.78 kDa. Through splits decomposition and analysis of alignment, after block curing, we could estimate the proportion of invariant sites as 68.54% and the segregant sites counted was 77 in amino acid base. These findings suggest a tendency of recurrent duplications and/ or insertions, as well as deletions evidenced by variations in the length and mass of protein ranging between approximately 25% and 4.62 fold, respectively. But it is important
