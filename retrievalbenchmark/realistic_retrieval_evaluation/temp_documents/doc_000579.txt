Title: Type I Interferon Response Is Delayed in Human Astrovirus Infections
Passage: Results suggest that HAstV infection is not able to disrupt the innate immune sensing pathway induced by polyI:C . Only a previous infection with RV was able to reduce by 60% the IFN-Î² mRNA levels produced after polyI:C transfection, although differences were not statistically significant . HAstV and RV yields were similar between mock-transfected wells and wells transfected with polyI:C . As expected, antiviral activity in the supernatant of cultures at 32 hpi could only be detected in cells transfected with polyI:C, and the response could only be reduced by the presence of rotavirus infection .
