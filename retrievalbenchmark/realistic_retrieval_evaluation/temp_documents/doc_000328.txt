Title: Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 Inhibits Hantaan Virus Infection, and Its Single Nucleotide Polymorphism rs12252 Influences the Severity of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome
Passage: Previous studies reveal that the truncated IFITM3 protein produced by SNP rs12252 C allele leads to an impaired anti-influenza activity . To test the functional significance of this polymorphism in HTNV infection, we transfected the majority T or minority C variant IFITM3 alleles that produce full-length or N-terminally truncated proteins with c-myc-tag to HUVEC and A549 cell using lentivirus vectors . Then, we challenged the cells with HTNV at moi = 1 for 24 h and found that cells with the minority C variant were more susceptible to HTNV infection with higher expression of HTNV S segment and more positive
