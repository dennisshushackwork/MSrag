Title: Inhibiting the Ins and Outs of HIV Replication: Cell-Intrinsic Antiretroviral Restrictions at the Plasma Membrane
Passage: The use of CCR5 appears to be essential for sexual transmission of HIV-1. Viruses that use CCR5 alone , or more rarely CCR5 and CXCR4 ], predominate in early infection . Individuals homozygous for a 32 base pair deletion in CCR5 that disrupts its expression are largely HIV-1 resistant . X4-using viruses tend to arise later in infection in some, but not all, individuals, and are associated with more rapid progression to AIDS. Whilst they can be transmitted by intravenous drug-use/transfusion, it is not clear why X4 viruses are almost never transmitted sexually given that target CD4+ T cells in
