Title: Self-assembly into virusâ€“like particles of the recombinant capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 3 and its application on antibodies detection
Passage: In conclusion, this is the first report of the ability of PCV3 VLPs to self-assemble which were successfully expressed in E. coli and applied in the development of an ELISA for testing the specific antibodies of clinical pig serum. The VLP ELISA was highly specific, sensitive and reproducible, it is a valuable tool to monitor the prevalence of the PCV3 virus. The invention of virus-like particles will play a significant role in providing a new tool for the study of PCV3.
