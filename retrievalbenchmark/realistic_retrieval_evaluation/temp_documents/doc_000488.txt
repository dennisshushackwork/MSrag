Title: Viral vector-based influenza vaccines
Passage: Adeno-associated virus is a parvovirus that is replication-deficient in humans. Like adenovirus, AAV has a broad cell, tissue and host tropism and therefore is a potential good vector vaccine. 218 However, drawbacks of using AAV include: limited capacity for transgenes, presence of pre-existing immunity in humans and the technical challenge of producing high titer stocks. Initially, AAV was not explored as a vaccine vector as it was considered to be poorly immunogenic, however vaccination studies in mice showed that AAV-2 expressing an HSV-2 glycoprotein was immunogenic and a potent inducer of Tcell and antibody responses, 219 and currently modifications are
