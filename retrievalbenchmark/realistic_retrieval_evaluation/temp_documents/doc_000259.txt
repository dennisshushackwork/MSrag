Title: HIV-1 Replication and the Cellular Eukaryotic Translation Apparatus
Passage: Eukaryotic translation is a complex process orchestrated by a wide range of players, including several protein factors and three classes of RNA , transfer RNA , and messenger RNA ). This process is comprised of three main steps: initiation, elongation and termination. Immediately after transcription, mRNAs are maturated and exported through the nuclear pores to the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, cap-dependent translation is initiated by the recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit , which scans along the mRNA until it finds an initiation codon. At this point, the large ribosomal subunit is engaged to decode the mRNA and assembles
