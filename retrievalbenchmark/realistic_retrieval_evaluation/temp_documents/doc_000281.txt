Title: A Phylogeny-Based Global Nomenclature System and Automated Annotation Tool for H1 Hemagglutinin Genes from Swine Influenza A Viruses
Passage: were placed into seven clades. The numerically dominant clades reflected intensive surveillance in the United States , investigator sequencing efforts in Canada , and the rapid dissemination of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus across global swine populations . Similarly, coordinated surveillance in Europe and Asia captured two primary clades of 1C Eurasian avian lineage currently circulating in the two continents.
