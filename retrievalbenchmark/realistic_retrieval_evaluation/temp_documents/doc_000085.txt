Title: Advanced Molecular Surveillance of Hepatitis C Virus
Passage: HCV is spontaneously cleared by the host in up to 15% of acutely infected individuals . It has been reported that an early functional inactivation of the HCV-specific CD4+ T cell response may play a major role in establishing viral persistence , and such dysfunctional T cells can be functionally reactivated . Several studies have suggested that differences in host immune responses determine viral clearance. Indeed, the intensity of the immune response can be dictated, at least in part, by host genetic factors . However, the role of host factors in HCV clearance is not well understood. Different studies have
