Title: Virus Adaptation by Manipulation of Host's Gene Expression
Passage: The seven mutant genotypes created in this study were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikchangeH II XL kit and following the indications of the manufacturer. Mutagenic primers were also designed according to Stratagene recommendations. To minimize unwanted errors during the mutagenesis process, the kit incorporates the PfuUltra TM high fidelity DNA polymerase. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by sequencing. To assess the presence of undesired mutations on each clone, the Surveyor TM Mutation Detection Kit Standard Gel Electrophoresis was employed. All six mutant genotypes presented the expected genome-wide band pattern.
