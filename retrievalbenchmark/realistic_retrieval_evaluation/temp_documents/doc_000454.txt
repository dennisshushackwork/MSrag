Title: A Phylogeny-Based Global Nomenclature System and Automated Annotation Tool for H1 Hemagglutinin Genes from Swine Influenza A Viruses
Passage: Clade designations for 1A swine lineage. The 1A lineage contained 1,889 viruses from 34 countries collected from 2010 to the present . According to our nomenclature rules, we refined the classification of 1A viruses into three second-order divisions, each of which corresponds to earlier, regional classifica- Table 2 . Each clade had an APD of Ͼ7% from other clades and an APD of Ͻ7% within the clade, although some minor exceptions were made when all other clade-defining criteria were met and mitigating circumstances supported the exception. Within-clade exceptions were made for the first-order 1A.1 and the extensive 1A.1.1 second-order clade
