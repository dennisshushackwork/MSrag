Passage: at 10000 rpm for 10 min at 4uC. The supernatant was transferred to a pre-chilled 1.5-ml tube and 56SDS sample loading buffer was added. The mixture was boiled for 4 min, chilled on ice for 2 min, and then spun at 13000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. The yielded supernatant was stored at 220uC for SDS-PAGE.
