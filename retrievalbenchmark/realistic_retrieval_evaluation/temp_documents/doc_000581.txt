Title: A Phylogeny-Based Global Nomenclature System and Automated Annotation Tool for H1 Hemagglutinin Genes from Swine Influenza A Viruses
Passage: Clade designations for 1C swine lineage. The 1C lineage consisted of 315 viruses from 14 countries collected from 2010 to the present in China and South Korea. Avian H1 HA sequences were generally restricted to two monophyletic clades distinct from, but sister to, the 1C swine viruses: these HA sequences were defined as "Other-Avian." The within-and between-clade APDs are presented in Table 4 . For the most part, each clade had an APD of Ͼ7% from other clades and an APD of Ͻ7% within the clade. The one within-clade exception in this lineage was 1C.2 , which had multiple monophyletic
