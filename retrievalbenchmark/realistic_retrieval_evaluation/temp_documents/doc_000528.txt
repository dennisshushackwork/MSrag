Title: Deep sequencing analysis of viral infection and evolution allows rapid and detailed characterization of viral mutant spectrum
Passage: of 0.00043 mutations/nucleotide, while the low fidelity variants presented roughly 3-fold more . When all minority variants identified by ViVan were taken into account, regardless of their frequency , the diversity of all three virus populations were significantly higher. Wild type virus, in particular, had higher than expected frequencies of 0.00107 mutations/nucleotide in the region previously sequenced by Gn√§ dig et al., and 0.000996 mutations/nucleotide across the entire genome. These data suggest that the higher sensitivity of HTS identifies more extremely low-frequency variants than would otherwise be detected by other available methods. Indeed, when cut-off thresholds of 0.005 or 0.01
