Title: Deciphering Biosignatures in Planetary Contexts
Passage: The actual rule boundaries are shown by the light blue lines and the rules are listed at the top. Gray indicates regions lacking data . Dark green indicates that only histogram G had a nonzero value for that density/ neighbor count, while dark pink indicates only histogram R had a nonzero value. Light green indicates that histogram B had a higher frequency than histogram A at that density, and light pink indicates that histogram A had a higher frequency than histogram B at that density. It is readily apparent that boundaries between the histogram regions outlined above correspond very closely
