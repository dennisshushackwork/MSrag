Title: Respiratory Viral Infections in Exacerbation of Chronic Airway Inflammatory Diseases: Novel Mechanisms and Insights From the Upper Airway Epithelium
Passage: of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.
