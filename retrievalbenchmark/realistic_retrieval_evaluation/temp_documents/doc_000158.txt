Title: Virus Adaptation by Manipulation of Host's Gene Expression
Passage: To further characterize the relationship between these changes and symptoms severity, we introduced them by site-directed mutagenesis in the ancestral TEV clone. In addition, all three possible pairs of non-synonymous mutations and the triple non- synonymous mutant were also created. A. thaliana Ler plants were inoculated with these nine mutant clones and maintained in the same growth conditions for three weeks. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 1 . All mutant genotypes were viable and replicated and accumulated in the plants, as confirmed by Western blot analysis . Among the three single mutants, the only clone that
