Title: Self-assembly into virusâ€“like particles of the recombinant capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 3 and its application on antibodies detection
Passage: VLPs, composed of viral structural proteins without genetic materials, are self-assembled macromolecules. Because of their ability in stimulating strong immune response and plentiful antibody production, they are regarded as candidates of novel vaccines. . VLPs provide more safety in use and the possibility of large scale production of vaccines with reproducible high quality results compared with traditional live-attenuated or inactivated virus vaccines . Some VLPs, such as Hepatitis B surface antigen VLPs, human papillomavirus VLPs and Malaria VLPbase vaccines have already been clinically used for the prevention of infectious diseases . In recent years, the technology of expressing capsid protein
