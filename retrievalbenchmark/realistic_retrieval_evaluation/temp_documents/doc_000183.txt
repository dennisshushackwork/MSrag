Title: In vitro comparison between inspiration synchronized and continuous vibrating mesh nebulizer during trans-nasal aerosol delivery
Passage: duration at the beginning 50% of inspiratory phase; more studies might be needed to explore different aerosol spray durations to seek for the optimal percentage. Lastly, similar to all the in vitro studies , the manikin's airway did not have physiological functions such as heat and humidify the gas, filter and absorb the medication by the upper airway, etc; additionally, the filter can capture all the aerosol while some aerosol might be exhaled in vivo, contributing to the higher aerosol deposition in the lung with in vitro study.
