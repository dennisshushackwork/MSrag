restricted cash and marketable securities as of december 31 , 2015 , we had $ 100.3 million of restricted cash and marketable securities . we obtain funds through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the purpose of financing qualifying expenditures at our landfills , transfer stations , collection and recycling centers . the funds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authorities at the time of issuance . as the use of these funds is contractually restricted , and we do not have the ability to use these funds for general operating purposes , they are classified as restricted cash and marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets . in the normal course of business , we may be required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities in connection with municipal residential collection contracts , closure or post- closure of landfills , environmental remediation , environmental permits , and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance . at several of our landfills , we satisfy financial assurance requirements by depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts . property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost . expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized , while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred . when property is retired or otherwise disposed , the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of income. .
