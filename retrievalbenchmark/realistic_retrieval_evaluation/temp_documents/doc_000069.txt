Title: Quantitative Phosphoproteomics of Proteasome Inhibition in Multiple Myeloma Cells
Passage: Tubulin polymerization assay was performed essentially as previously described . Briefly, cells grown to confluency in 24-well plates were washed twice with 1X PBS. To separate polymerized from soluble tubulin, the cells were all incubated at 37uC for 5 min in the dark in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 5 mM paclitaxel, 10 mM Trichostatin-A , 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 100 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5.0 mM e-amino caproic acid, 1 mM benzamidine, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at ,15,000 g at 22uC for
