Title: The vacuolar-type ATPase inhibitor archazolid increases tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells by accumulating extracellular collagen
Passage: years. Archazolid A and B are highly potent and specific inhibitors of v-ATPases . They were first isolated from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra . These compounds inhibit v-ATPase at low nanomolar concentrations by binding to the subunit c of the V o complex. As their biological activity is comparable to the v-ATPase inhibitors bafilomycin and concanamycin , archazolids are natural compounds of high interest that can be used both as a tool to study the consequences of v-ATPase inhibition and as a lead for drug development. Archazolids can be either produced by fermentation or by total synthesis .
