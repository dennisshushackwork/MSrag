Title: The vacuolar-type ATPase inhibitor archazolid increases tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells by accumulating extracellular collagen
Passage: In the field of cancer research several studies reported on interesting pharmacological effects of archazolid: It reduced the migration of different invasive tumor cells in vitro and cancer cell metastasis in vivo in a breast tumor mouse model . Furthermore, archazolid activated pathways of cellular stress response and apoptosis in highly invasive tumor cells . In classically activated macrophages, archazolid selectively induced the generation of tumor necrosis factor Î± , which may indirectly promote tumor suppression .
