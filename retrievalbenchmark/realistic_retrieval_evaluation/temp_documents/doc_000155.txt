Title: Optimization Method for Forecasting Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in China
Passage: algorithm . In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks . The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using the World Health Organization official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error , Root Mean Squared Relative Error , Root Mean Squared
