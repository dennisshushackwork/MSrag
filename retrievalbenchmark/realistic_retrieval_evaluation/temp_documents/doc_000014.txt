Title: Selective use of primate CD4 receptors by HIV-1
Passage: range of virus dilutions on Cf2Th cells stably expressing human CD4 and CCR5. For infection assays, Cf2Th cells stably expressing CD4 and CCR5 were plated at 3 x 10 4 cells/well of a 48-well plate 24 hours prior to infection. The cells were then infected with HIV-1 pseudoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.6 in the presence of 5 Î¼g/ml of polybrene by spinoculation at 1,200 x g for 75 minutes. Fourty-eight hours post infection, the cells were harvested from the plate and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. The fixed cells were washed three times with
