Title: Estimation in emerging epidemics: biases and remedies
Passage: Another useful application of the above result is to countbased estimation of the case fatality rate . In this case, p represents the probability of dying from the disease. The problem has been treated by many authors under many different assumptions of data availability ). It is well known that a crude estimator of the type D/N, D denoting number of dead individuals and N number of notified individuals in , will underestimate the 'true' CFR. In theory, disregarding biased reporting, the underestimation is reflected in the integral part of equation , which is always less than 1, where h
