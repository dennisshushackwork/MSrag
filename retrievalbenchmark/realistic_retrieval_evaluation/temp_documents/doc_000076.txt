Title: Health care workers indicate ill preparedness for Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in Ashanti Region of Ghana
Passage: The results of this survey showed that more than half HCWs indicated that their facilities were not ready to handle EVD cases. Nearly 92% indicated they were not adequately trained to handle an EVD suspected case and it is not surprising that less than 50% indicated they would willingly attend to a suspected patient. Moreover, nearly a third of HCWs would also want insurance for themselves and their families in case they were infected with EVD.
