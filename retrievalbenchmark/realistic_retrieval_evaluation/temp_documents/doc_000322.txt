Title: Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide is a functional receptor for human hepatitis B and D virus
Passage: We next compared the efficiency of HBV infection in HepG2-hNTCP cells with that in PHHs. As shown by intracellular staining of HBV core antigen on day 8 post-infection, about 10% HepG2-NTCP cells were infected at multiplicities of genome equivalents of 100, which is comparable to the efficiency of HBV infection of PHHs . In contrast to PHHs, HepG2-NTCP cells propagate in cultures, thus the actual infection efficiency of HepG2-NTCP cells may be more likely than not underestimated by the observed end-point HBcAg staining. We also compared the levels of secreted HBeAg and intracellular viral RNAs in these two types of
