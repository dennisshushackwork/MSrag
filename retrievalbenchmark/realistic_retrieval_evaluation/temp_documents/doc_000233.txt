Title: N-substituted phenylbenzamides of the niclosamide chemotype attenuate obesity related changes in high fat diet fed mice
Passage: the well. The score is normalized per-plate to 0-100% effect using the "unstimulated control" and "stimulated + DMSO Vehicle" as controls. This bio-imaging platform consistently yielded an average Z-prime factor above 0.49. Moreover, the assay includes an internal measure to evaluate in vitro liver toxicity based on the nuclei counting feature using the Hoechst channel. Compounds were considered toxic if the cell count fell below 80% of the vehicle control values for cell number.
