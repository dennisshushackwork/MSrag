Title: Self-assembly into virusâ€“like particles of the recombinant capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 3 and its application on antibodies detection
Passage: of PCV2 and self-assembly into virus-like particles has advanced, and can be used in multiple recombinant protein expression systems including baculovirus, yeast and E. coli . Many commercial vaccines based on VLPs have effectively prevented the infection of PCV2 . Similar to PCV2, there are two major open reading frames , ORF1 and ORF2, in PCV3 genome. ORF2 encode the immunogenic Cap which is the sole structural protein of the viral coat . Whether the idea of forming recombinant Cap into VLPs is equally applicable to PCV3 is the main purpose in our research.
