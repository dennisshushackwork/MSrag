Title: Long-Acting HIV-1 Fusion Inhibitory Peptides and their Mechanisms of Action
Passage: be the promising candidate for treating and preventing HIV-1 infection. It is reported that in the early stage of HIV-1 infection, the co-receptor of HIV-1 is CCR5, which is then gradually converted into CCR5/CXCR4, and finally, further converted to CXCR4 . Because 47 strains of the virus in this study were mainly CCR5 strains, only 4 strains of CCR5/CXCR4, and no CXCR4 strain was detected, the effect of HIV-1 co-receptor utilization on the antiviral activity of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors could not be further analyzed.
